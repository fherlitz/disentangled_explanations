## outputs/

This directory contains all artifacts generated by the pipeline. Subfolders are created automatically by the scripts.

- `patch_wise_analysis/` and `pixel_wise_analysis/`
    - `baseline/` (not present)
      - `accuracy.json`: top-1 accuracy of DenseNet-121 on the val subset
      - `attributions/`: NPY attribution maps for IG and Saliency (not present)
      - `metrics.json`: aggregate sparsity and faithfulness stats for baseline
    - `filtered_block_*/` (not present)
      - One subfolder per filtered configuration, e.g. `filtered_block_1_cluster_0_k3/`
      - `attributions/`: attributions for the filtered model
      - `metrics.json`: sparsity, faithfulness, and `accuracy_top1` for the filtered model
    - Contains `mask_grid_summary.csv`, a summary of all (above) runs

- `neuron_stats/`
  - One subfolder per configuration: `block_<n>_k<k>/`
  - Contains per-block statistics (`stats_block_*.npz`), `cluster_results.npz` (labels, k), and a `manifest.json`

- `visualizations/`
  - PNG figure panels produced by `visualize_attribution.py` or `run_images_attribution.py`

- `decomposition_analysis/`
  - Per-image cluster decomposition results: `cluster_analysis_<method>_<img_idx>.(json|png)`
  - Aggregate statistics: `aggregate_stats_<method>.json`

- `patch_wise_evaluation/` and `pixel_wise_evaluation/`
  - Per-class CSVs and summary plots if you run `class_analysis.py`/`merge_classes.py`

- `control_random/`
  - Results and visualizations for random-neuron control experiments

- `accuracy/`
  - JSON files with top-1/top-5 accuracy for specified filtered configurations

- Root-level CSVs
  - `mask_grid_summary.csv`: consolidated table created by `collect_metrics.py` combining baseline and all filtered runs

Note: Large files are expected (attributions, PNGs). Keep sufficient disk space.
